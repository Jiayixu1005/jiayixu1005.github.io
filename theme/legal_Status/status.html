                In 1966 Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally entitled
                to renew the copyright upon
                the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing
                to a statement that the character
                had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was work for hire owned
                by them.
                <br>
                In 1999, Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the Copyright Act
                of 1976 which allowed the original
                creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year
                copyright term (but not the longer term
                enacted by the new legislation) had expired.Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the
                settlement of Simon's 1966 suit
                made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer. Simon and Marvel settled out
                of court in 2003, in a deal that paid
                Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character.
