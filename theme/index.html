        <h1>Origin of Captain America</h1>
        <p>Captain America is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
           Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated March 1941) 
            from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought 
             the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes 
             waned following the war and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel 
             Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.</p>

    <section id="Status">
        <h1>Legal Status</h1>
        <p>
            In 1966 Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally entitled to renew the copyright upon 
            the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character
            had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was work for hire owned by them.In 1999, Simon filed to claim 
            the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the Copyright Act of 1976 which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold
            to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term (but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation) had expired.
            Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the settlement of Simon's 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of 
            the copyright transfer. Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use 
            of the character.

        <h1>Ability</h1>
        <p>
            Captain America has no superhuman powers, but through the Super-Soldier Serum and "Vita-Ray" treatment, he is transformed and his strength, 
            endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are at the zenith of natural human potential. Rogers' body regularly replenishes 
            the super-soldier serum; it does not wear off.

            Although he lacks superhuman strength, Captain America is one of the few mortal beings who has been deemed worthy enough to wield Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
        </p>
        <h2>Tactician and field commander</h2>
        <p>
            Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to 
            his orders in battle. Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow "through the gates of Hades".
            Rogers' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen. He has blended Aikido, Boxing, Judo, Karate, Jujutsu, Kickboxing, and gymnastics into his 
            own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and
            throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or 
            even cause a boomerang-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best 
            hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his human physique. Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength, 
            Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his 
            pre-Captain America physique.

            Rogers has vast U.S. military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. 
            He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, parkour, military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile 
            as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through 
            his ongoing relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D.
        </p>
        <h2>Super-Soldier Serum</h2>
        <p>
                The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of 
                an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1,200 pounds (540 kg) and running a mile (1.6 km) in 73 seconds 
                (49 mph/78 kph, nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters). Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being 
                frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus.
