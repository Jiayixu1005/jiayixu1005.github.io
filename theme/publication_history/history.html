            <h2>Creation</h2>
            <p class="subpage-text">
                In 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in
                costume.
                "I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his autobiography, and
                then decided.
                <br>
                Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go-ahead
                and directed
                that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full
                comic with
                primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist Jack
                Kirby, could
                handle the workload alone.
                <br>
                Al Liederman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer,
                Howard Ferguson.
                Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by
                the actions
                of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in World War II and felt war
                was inevitable:
                "The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too."

            <h2>Golden Age</h2>
            <p class="subpage-text">
                Captain America Comics #1 — cover-dated March 1941 and on sale December 20, 1940, a year before the
                attack on Pearl Harbor,
                but a full year into World War II — showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler; it sold
                nearly one million copies.
                While most readers responded favorably to the comic, some took objection. Simon noted, "When the first
                issue came out we got a lot of
                ... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for." The threats,
                which included menacing groups of
                people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was
                posted with New York Mayor
                Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support.
                <br>
                Though preceded as a "patriotically themed superhero" by MLJ's The Shield, Captain America immediately
                became the most prominent and
                enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War
                II, as evidenced by the unusual
                move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first. This
                popularity drew the attention
                and a complaint from MLJ that the character's triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol
                of their Shield character.
                In response, Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2, which went on
                to become an iconic element of
                the character. With his sidekick Bucky, Captain America faced Nazis, Japanese, and other threats to
                wartime America and the Allies.
                Stanley Lieber, now better known as Stan Lee, contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler
                text story "Captain America Foils
                the Traitor's Revenge", which introduced the character's use of his shield as a returning throwing
                weapon. Captain America soon became
                Timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the "Sentinels of Liberty".
                <br>
                Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which
                outstripped even the circulation of news
                magazines such as Time during the period. After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC Comics in late
                1941, having produced Captain America
                Comics through issue #10 (January 1942), Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the
                celebrated title, with one generally
                inking over the other. The character was featured in All Winners Comics #1–19 (Summer 1941 – Fall
                1946), Marvel Mystery Comics #80–84 and
                #86–92, USA Comics #6–17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and All Select Comics #1–10 (Fall 1943 – Summer
                1946).
                <br>
                In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely's first
                superhero team, the All-Winners Squad,
                in its two published adventures, in All Winners Comics #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no
                issue #20). After Bucky was shot and
                wounded in a 1948 Captain America story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend, Betsy Ross,
                who became the superheroine Golden
                Girl. Captain America Comics ran until issue #73 (July 1949), at which time the series was retitled
                Captain America's Weird Tales for two
                issues, with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.
                <br>
                Atlas Comics attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with
                the original Human Torch and the
                Sub-Mariner, in Young Men #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as "Captain America, Commie Smasher!" Captain America
                appeared during the next year in
                Young Men #24–28 and Men's Adventures #27–28, as well as in issues #76–78 of an eponymous title. Atlas'
                attempted superhero revival was
                a commercial failure, and the character's title was canceled with Captain America #78 (Sept. 1954).

            <h2>Silver and Bronze Age</h2>
            <p class="subpage-text">
                In the Human Torch story titled "Captain America" in Marvel Comics' Strange Tales #114 (Nov. 1963),
                writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and
                co-plotter Jack Kirby depicted the brash young Fantastic Four member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in
                an exhibition performance with
                Captain America, described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many
                years of apparent retirement.
                The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain
                the Acrobat, a former circus performer
                the Torch had defeated in Strange Tales #106, who broke two thieves out of jail, hoping to draw the
                police away while trying to rob the local
                bank. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers.
                A caption in the final panel says
                this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return. According to Lee, fan
                response to the tryout was very enthusiastic.
                <br>
                Captain America was then formally reintroduced in The Avengers #4 (March 1964), which explained that in
                the final days of World War II, he had
                fallen from an experimental drone plane into the North Atlantic Ocean and spent decades frozen in a
                block of ice in a state of suspended
                animation. The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team. Following the
                success of other Marvel characters
                introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero "haunted by past memories, and trying
                to adapt to 1960s society".
                <br>
                After then guest-starring in the feature "Iron Man" in Tales of Suspense #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain
                America gained his own solo feature in that
                "split book", beginning the following issue. Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America's
                origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was
                a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America's Golden Age sidekick, Bucky.
                Kirby drew all but two of the stories
                in Tales of Suspense, which became Captain America with #100 (April 1968); Gil Kane and John Romita
                Sr., each filled in once. Several stories
                were finished by penciller-inker George Tuska over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and
                another by penciller Dick Ayers and
                inker John Tartaglione. Kirby's regular inkers on the series were Frank Giacoia (as "Frank Ray") and
                Joe Sinnott, though Don Heck and
                Golden Age Captain America artist Syd Shores inked one story each.
                <br>
                This series — considered Captain America volume one by comics researchers and historians, following the
                1940s Captain America Comics and its
                1950s numbering continuation of Tales of Suspense — ended with #454 (Aug. 1996).
                <br>
                This series was almost immediately followed by the 13-issue Captain America vol. 2 (Nov. 1996 – Nov.
                1997, part of the "Heroes Reborn" crossover),
                the 50-issue Captain America vol. 3 (Jan. 1998 – Feb. 2002),[28] the 32-issue Captain America vol. 4
                (June 2002 – Dec. 2004),[29] and
                Captain America vol. 5 (Jan. 2005 – Aug. 2011). Beginning with the 600th overall issue (Aug. 2009),
                Captain America resumed its original
                numbering, as if the series numbering had continued uninterrupted after #454.

            <h2>Modern Age</h2>
            <p class="subpage-text">
                As part of the aftermath of Marvel Comics' company-crossover storyline "Civil War", Steve Rogers was
                ostensibly killed in Captain America vol. 5,
                #25 (March 2007).The storyline of Rogers' return began in issue #600. Rogers, who was not dead but
                caroming through time, returned to the
                present day in the six-issue miniseries Captain America: Reborn (Sept. 2009 – March 2010).
                <br>
                After Rogers' return, Barnes, at Rogers' insistence, continued as Captain America, beginning in the
                one-shot comic Captain America:
                Who Will Wield the Shield? (Feb. 2010). While Bucky Barnes continued adventuring in the pages of
                Captain America, Steve Rogers received his
                own miniseries (Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier) as well as taking on the leadership position in a new
                Secret Avengers ongoing series.
                <br>
                Spinoff series included Captain America Sentinel of Liberty (Sept. 1998 – Aug. 1999) and Captain
                America and the Falcon (May 2004 – June 2005).
                The 1940s Captain America appeared alongside the 1940s Human Torch and Sub-Mariner in the 12-issue
                miniseries Avengers/Invaders.
                The 2007 mini-series Captain America: The Chosen, written by David Morrell and penciled by Mitchell
                Breitweiser, depicts a dying Steve Rogers'
                final minutes, at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, as his spirit guides James Newman, a young American Marine
                fighting in Afghanistan. The Chosen is
                not part of the main Marvel Universe continuity.
                <br>
                During the "Two Americas" storyline that ran in issues #602-605, the series drew controversy for the
                similarity between protesters depicted in
                the comic and the Tea Party movement. Particularly drawing scorn was a panel of a protester holding
                sign that read "Tea Bag the Libs Before They
                Tea Bag You!" Also drawing controversy were remarks made by the Falcon implying that the crowd is
                racist. In his column on Comic Book Resources,
                Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada apologized for the sign, claiming that it was mistake added
                by the letterer at the last minute.
                <br>
                The character, first as agent Steve Rogers and later after resuming his identity as Captain America,
                appeared as a regular character throughout
                the 2010–2013 Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).
                The character appeared as agent Steve Rogers
                as a regular character in the 2010–2013 Secret Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue
                #21 (March 2012); the character made
                guest appearances as Captain America in issues #21.1, #22–23, #35, and the final issue of the series
                #37 (March 2013).
                <br>
                Marvel stated in May 2011 that Rogers, following the public death of Bucky Barnes in the Fear Itself
                miniseries, would resume his Captain America
                identity in a sixth volume of Captain America, by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Steve McNiven. The
                Captain America title continued from issue #620
                featuring team up stories with Bucky (#620-#628), Hawkeye (#629-#632), Iron Man (#633–635), Namor
                (#635.1), and Black Widow (#636-#640), and
                the title ended its print run with issue #640.
                <br>
                Captain America is a regular character in Uncanny Avengers (2012), beginning with issue #1 as part of
                Marvel NOW!. Captain America vol. 7 was
                launched in November 2012 with a January 2013 cover date by writer Rick Remender and artist John Romita
                Jr..
                <br>
                On July 16, 2014 Marvel Comics announced that the mantle of Captain America would be passed on by
                Rogers (who in the most recent storyline has
                been turned into a 90-year-old man) to his long-time ally The Falcon, with the series being relaunched
                as All-New Captain America.
